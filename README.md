I have a issue with the deploment Link and with the api. I was not able to resolve.

For millennia, people have turned to yoga as a means of finding calm inside themselves. Yoga was formerly inaccessible to a wider audience, but technological advancements have changed all that. You may find many useful Yoga-related materials on the Yoga Website, an online hub dedicated to the practise.
To aid its users in establishing a consistent Yoga practise, the website offers guided Yoga, Yoga exercises, and other tools. The Yoga Website offers something to offer everyone, from complete beginners to seasoned yogis.

The Yoga Website's collection of guided Yoga practises is a major selling point. Stress reduction, anxiety lessening, and self-compassion are just few of the many subjects covered in these Yoga sessions guided by knowledgeable instructors.
Users can unwind and concentrate on their breathing with the help of relaxing music and graphics during each Yoga session. Guided Yoga practises like these have been shown to have positive effects on health and well-being when practised regularly.

The Yoga Website not only provides guided Yoga, but also a wide range of mindfulness exercises. Users can improve their emotional and physical self-awareness through these practises.
Yoga, deep breathing, and the practise of loving-kindness are all examples of mindfulness activities. Regular practitioners of mindfulness reap the benefits of less stress and anxiety, enhanced focus, and an enhanced sense of well-being.

Meditation enthusiasts can find a welcoming group on the Yoga Website as well. Users can talk to people who are interested in the same things they are, get answers to their questions, and learn from one another.
Expert practitioners who can provide direction and encouragement manage the community forum. People who are just starting out with Yoga and aren't sure where to start might benefit greatly from this sense of belonging.

One of the features of the Redux Toolkit is the configureStore() function, which simplifies the configuration options and provides solid defaults by wrapping createStore. It incorporates redux-thunk by default, allows you to use the Redux DevTools Extension, and can automatically aggregate your slice reducers.
In place of writing switch statements, you may use createReducer() to offer a lookup table of action types to case reducer functions. Additionally, the immer library is utilised mechanically so that standard mutative code, such as state, can be used to write simpler immutable updates.todos[3].Finished = True.
For a specified action type string, createAction() will build an action creator function. toString() is declared within the method itself, allowing it to be used in place of the type constant.
The createSlice() method builds a slice reducer with the appropriate action creators and action types given a reducer function object, a slice name, and an initial state value.
* createAsyncThunk: takes an action type string and a promise-returning function, and returns a thunk that dispatches pending/fulfilled/rejected action types according to the promise. * createEntityAdapter: generates a set of reusable reducers and selectors to manage normalised data in the store.
* A re-export of the createSelector programme from the Reselect library.
* It adds further code to help optimise the state in accordance with best practises. * It simplifies and cleans up the code by reducing the amount of repetitive boilerplate. Developing scalable software won't necessitate installing additional packages. * It simplifies the development of advanced software by removing the need to create unused reducers and actions.

The Next.js framework is a React-based toolkit for developing websites and apps.
When we say that Next.js acts as a framework, we mean that it takes care of the necessary settings and tooling for React and that it adds structure, features, and optimisations to your app.


Next.js is a versatile React framework that provides you all the necessary components to make dynamic web apps.

When designing cutting-edge software, there are several important details to remember. Examples include: * User Interface, or the means by which your application's target audience will access and utilise it.
* Routing — the method by which people move across your app.
* Data retrieval (or "Fetching") – knowing where and how to access data.
* Rendering — how and where you display pre-rendered or live material.
Integrations: how your site communicates with any other resources (content management system, authentication provider, payment processor, etc.).
Locations (Serverless, CDN, Edge, etc.) where application code is deployed, stored, and executed.
How to improve your app's performance for users.
How well your programme scales to accommodate an expanding workforce, dataset, and user base.
This is where the experience of your development team in creating and maintaining your application comes in.
For each feature of your project, you'll need to choose between writing custom code and making use of preexisting solutions in the form of libraries and frameworks.
